-   Frame offset - trigger n half-steps after detecting frame hole
    -   Prototype use Config.h value, then: [done]
    -   Load value from EEPROM at startup
-   Brownout control 
    -   reset audio [done]
    -   stop feed [done]
    -   save runtime / usage count to EEPROM
        -   do not increment usage count if already saved this run
-   Buttons:
    -   Manual feed button (slowish forward motion for loading film) [part done - need customizable speed]
    -   Frame offset adjust (press once to change, save to EEPROM) [part done - need EEPROM save]
-   Metrics:
    -   Write into EEPROM:
        -   Number of uses
        -   Total duration
        -   Audio readout of numbers...
